## Future Additions

Future additions to this project may include two different types of users, a traveler or a travel agent.

As a travel agent, upon logging in:

The agent should see a dashboard page that shows:
New trip requests (a user’s “pending” trips)
Total income generated this year (should be 10% of user trip cost)
Travelers on trips for today’s date (number, names, however you want to display this!)
As a travel agent:

The agent should be able to see and approve / deny trip requests
The agent should be able to search for any user by name and:
View their name, a list of all of their trips, and the total amount they’ve spent (including 10% agent cut)
Approve a trip request for that user
Delete an upcoming trip for that user
